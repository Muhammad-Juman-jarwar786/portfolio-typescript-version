However, this was not easy, as I could not find any good teacher or resource in my small city, Tando Allahyar. I had to rely on online tutorials and forums, and I faced many challenges and errors along the way. But I did not give up, and I eventually learned JavaScript. I also learned React.js, a popular framework for building user interfaces with JavaScript.
